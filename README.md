### Project Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze road transport accident data in Nigeria from 2018 to 2024 in order to uncover patterns, trends, and risk factors influencing accident occurrence and severity. The dashboard aims to evaluate accident distribution across different times of day, road types, weather conditions, and states while assessing the overall impact in terms of total cases, injuries, fatalities, and crashes. Ultimately, the goal is to generate data-driven insights that can support road safety planning, infrastructure improvement, and policy formulation to reduce accident rates and improve public safety nationwide.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
This involves exploring the Billionaire data to answer key questions, such as:
1.  Total Accidents
2.  Total Crashes
3. Total people killed from the accidents
4.  Total injured
5.  Total cases
6.  Accident Condition
7.  Time of Day of Accidents
8.  Accident by road type
9.  Weather conditions
10. Geographical insight of the 36 states in Nigeria and the amount of accident recorded

### Data Analysis
New Measures function and power query was used to analyze the data to answer questions.

###  Results and Findings

---
1. High Injury Burden: Out of 697,000 total cases, 421,000 resulted in injuries, while 72,000 resulted in fatalities and 204,000 were classified as crashes. Injuries represent the largest proportion, highlighting a significant public health burden.
2. Evening Has the Highest Accident Occurrence: Accidents peak in the evening (283 cases), followed by afternoon (276), night (241), and morning (236). This suggests increased risk during peak traffic and reduced visibility hours.
3. ural Roads Record the Highest Cases: Rural roads account for 193,000 cases, the highest among all road types, followed by State roads (182,000), Urban roads (167,000), and Federal highways (154,000). This points to potential infrastructure and enforcement gaps in rural areas
4. Majority of Cases Occur Under One Dominant Condition: One accident condition category accounts for 109,000 cases (53.74%), significantly higher than the others (57,000 and 37,000). This suggests that accidents frequently occur even outside extreme or adverse conditions.
5. Accidents Are Nationwide: The geographic distribution map shows accident cases spread across multiple Nigerian states, indicating that road transport accidents are a widespread national issue rather than region-specific.

  ### Recommendations
1. Strengthen evening traffic enforcement and improve street lighting in high-traffic zones.
2. Prioritize rural road infrastructure upgrades, including signage, markings, and road maintenance.
3. Intensify public safety campaigns on seatbelt use, helmet compliance, and defensive driving.
4. Deploy speed monitoring systems and automated traffic enforcement technologies.
5. Enhance emergency medical response systems to reduce injury and fatality rates.
6. Implement state-specific road safety strategies based on hotspot analysis.
7. Enforce stricter penalties for traffic violations and conduct regular vehicle safety inspections.
